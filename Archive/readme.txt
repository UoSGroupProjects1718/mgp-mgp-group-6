This archive exists to preserve any concept art and research from the "ducks with arms" era. 

The contents of this archive may prove useful moving forwards, however if mixed with the rest of our current work may quickly become confusing.

Other research (notably that on UX, for example) that currently resides in the main file structure may directly reference the older "ducks with arms" theme, however any old
concept artwork/final assets have been moved into this archive.

A seperate archive for older Builds exists in the 'Builds' folder.
